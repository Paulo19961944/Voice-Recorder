# Voice Recorder
This is my first Voice Recorder. A Front-End Project, the first of year of 2024. This project using few lines in HTML, enough just to make the structure of the website. In CSS used a div in center, just a content in column. Used flexbox to responsivity, and media screen to Mobile.

# JS Code
The project in JavaScript was used the Buttons in a document.getElementById because are individualty buttons. Was used a media recorder in JS, and Arrow Functions to a clean code, and receive a false, and when Download Button was clicked, the audio is downloaded. And a try-catch to exceptions too. And the logic in button choosed indviduality.

# Conclusion
I was fun in this project and I'm so Happy in this project ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.
